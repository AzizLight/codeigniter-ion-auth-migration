Ion Auth Database Migration

======================================

Hey everybody,

If you are using the ion auth authentication library, this is a default migration and data
that mimic's ion auth's sql file.


INSTALLATION:
- You must have codeigniter-migrations installed (https://github.com/philsturgeon/codeigniter-migrations)
- You must have codeigniter-ion-auth installed (https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth)

Just copy the files from this package to the corresponding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy 001_Create_ion_auth.php to 
application/migrations/001_Create_ion_auth.php. 



Thanks,
